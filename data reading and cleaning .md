STEPS
=======
STEP 1:
s3 to hdfs data ingestion ::

hdfs dfs -cp s3n://us-accident/US_Accidents_June20.csv ProjectData/

#STEP 2:
from pyspark.sql import SQLContext

df = sqlContext.read.format('com.databricks.spark.csv').options(header='true',inferschema='true').load("ProjectData/US_Accidents_June20.csv")

df.count()

df.printSchema()


Rename a column name
======================

df=df.withColumnRenamed("Distance(mi)","Distance")

df=df.withColumnRenamed("Temperature(F)","Temperature")

df=df.withColumnRenamed("Wind_Chill(F)","Wind_Chill")

df=df.withColumnRenamed("Humidity(%)","Humidity")

df=df.withColumnRenamed("Pressure(in)","Pressure")

df=df.withColumnRenamed("Visibility(mi)","Visibility")

df=df.withColumnRenamed("Wind_Speed(mph)","Wind_Speed")

df=df.withColumnRenamed("Precipitation(in)","Precipitation")


Drop column which is not required
===================================

df = df.drop("TMC","Source","End_Lat","End_Lng","Number","County","Precipitation")

df.printSchema()

df.describe().show()



Now Replace NaN values with mean on some features
===================================================

from pyspark.sql.functions import mean

mean_press=clean_df.select(mean(clean_df.
